## Autocomplete demo in Haskell
 - Simple project that does dictionary based word-complete via a web interface
 - Mainly an experiment to play around with Haskell

## Tech used

 - Scotty
 - Aeson

## Work yet to be done
 - code definitely HAS TO BE CLEANED UP! and some more work has to be done
 - React based interface
 - Dockerify the whole thing
